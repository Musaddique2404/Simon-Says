<h3><u> THE RULES OF THE SIMON SAYS GAME </u></h3>
<p> <b>The principle of the game is simple:</b> The player have to memorize the series of illuminated keys and reproduce it. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of colors / sounds randomly generated by the Simon.
    In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes increasingly difficult because the player's memory is more and more solicited.</p>
<div class="content">
<ol>
    <li> At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated to the key.</li>
    <li>The player has to press the same key.</li>
    <li> Next, the Simon turns back the same light on and a second one, again randomly.</li>
    <li>The player has to reproduce this chain of light using his memory.</li>
    <li>And so on... In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test.</li>
    <li>If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an endless game!</li>
